In this Environment we are Verifing 1 Instatnce of Conv Module and Flow is simple 
Sequence ->Driver -> DUT ->Monitor -> Scoreboard 
There is a referance model of convolution to verify the answers of Conv.
Driver is sending input to DUT and also to Scoreboard by using TLM ports.
Monitor is recieving Output of DUT and then tranfering it to Scoreboard by using TLM ports.
In Scoreboard there are 2 fifos which will recieve Inputs from Driver and DUT Output from Monitor 
and then give same input to Refrance model and recieve output from Refrance model and compair that with DUT output.
